When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  - to keep control

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  - for logical commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  - Forks are clones on github
  - Clones are local copies or a repository
  - branches are side-copies of the master branch with different code

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  - it would be harder to track the different versions and keep everything together and up to date

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  - master is the stable build version
  - branches for new features, fixing bugs etc...
